Due to using tqdm.notebook outputs do not open correctly on github, therefore for notebooks that included tqdm.notebook I included 2 notebooks. One with prefix with_output, that doesn't open correctly on github,
but it has visible output (note it's just sample output, that shows that code works correctly, as having lots of outputs within notebooks was unfeasible due to google colab becoming unusable due to lags)
So the versions without with_output prefix, can be viewed from github but if they used tqdm.notebook they had to have outputs deleted for the code to be viewable. 
Versions with prefix with_output can be viewed with outputs, by downloading and opening for example in visual studio.

Note: (Turns out notebooks might open correctly in the anonymized repo version, however just to make sure everything opens correctly I still attach both versions for files that github viewed initially as "Invalid Notebooks")
